This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we love, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life, but not together
Wake up in the mornin', stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I'd guess I wish you well
Mmh, a little bit of Heaven, but a little bit of Hell
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope, or love, or glory, happy ending's gone forevermore
I feel as if I'm wasted
And I'm wastin' every day
This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we love, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life, but not together
Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walking around
If I pretend that nothing ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope, or love, or glory, happy ending's gone forevermore
I feel as if I'm wasted
And I'm wastin' every day
This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we love, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life, but not together
Little bit of love
Little bit of love

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I'm wastin' every day
Hey, hey, hey, hey
This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we loved, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our lives, but not together
This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we loved, like it's for ever
Then live the rest of our lives, but not together
This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
Over my shoulder, running away
Feels like I'm falling, losing my day
Cold and dry
Cold and dry
Forgot my daylight, torture my night
Feels like I'm falling, far out of sight
Cold, drunk
Time lost
Over my shoulder, running away
Feels like I'm falling, losing my way
Cold, dry
Cold and dry
Forgot my daylight, torture my night
Feels like I'm falling, far out of sight
Cold, drunk
Cold and drunk
