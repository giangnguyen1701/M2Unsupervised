I know a place we could go
I know a place where there aren't any roads
Where the grass is always greener
And doesn't scratch your fingers
I know a place
So come with me dear
The halogen hum hurts my ears
Swim in the spring
We could be free
'Cause I know a place we could go
No one has been there, and no one will know
There it is quiet, forget the violence
You've tried so hard to ignore
Oh, I know a place we could go
Unpack our bags and we'll call it a home
The sea will sing our minds to sleep
I know a place we could go
And once we get there we could stay
An old shaky house, our lives would be made
And I don't know all the answers
But you look like December
There we could stay
I'm tired of fear
Grasping for safe, familiar
You are like me, oh, could we leave?
'Cause I know a place we could go
Far from the highways, far from that home
Seep in the silence, safe in our minds that
We try so hard to control
Oh, I know a place we could go
No one will notice once we are gone
Up in the trees, laugh on the beach
I know a place we could go
Can we go home?
'Cause I know a place we could go
Deep in the forest, out of the storm
Our souls could be freed of the disease
That everyone tried to destroy
Oh, I know a place we could go
No one has been there, no one will know
The sea will sing our minds to sleep
I know a place we could go
Could we go home?
