It's amazing how you
Can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word
You can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face let's me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best
When you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear
People talking out loud (ooh)
But when you hold me near (you hold me near)
You drown out the crowd (drown out the crowd)
Try as they may they can never define
What's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face let's me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (you say it best)
When you say nothing at all
the smile on your face let's me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me (ooh)
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (you say it best)
When you say nothing at all
that smile on your face
(You say it best when you say nothing at all) the truth in your eyes
(You say it best when you say nothing at all) the touch of your hand let's me know that you need me
(You say it best when you say nothing at all) nothing at all
(You say it best when you say nothing at all) nothing at all
(You say it best when you say nothing at all) nothing at all
