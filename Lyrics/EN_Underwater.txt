Bursting in a blood red sky
A slow landslide
And the world we leave behind
There's a way to lose your head
And disappear and not return again
When I fall to my feet
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve
All I see just amazes
You are the port of my call
You shot and leavin' me raw ?
Now I know you're amazing
'Cause all I need
Is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me and
I can live under water,
Under water, under water!
Under water!
Bursting with a bright blue sky
A slow landslide
And the world I've left behind
There's a way to lose your head
And disappear
And not return again
When I fall to my feet
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve
All I see just amazes
You are the port of my call
You shot and leavin' me raw ?
Now I know you're amazing
'Cause all I need
Is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me and
I can live under water,
Under water, under water!
Under water!
Bursting with a blood red sky
A slow landslide
And the world I've left behind
