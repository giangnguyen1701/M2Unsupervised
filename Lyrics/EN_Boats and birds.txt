If you'll be my star
I'll be your sky
You can hide underneath me and come out at night
When I turn jet black, and you show off your light
I live to let you shine
But you can skyrocket away from me
And never come back of you find another galaxy
Far from here
With more room to fly
Just leave me your stardust to remember you by
If you'll be my boat
I'll be your sea
A depth of pure blue
Just to probe curiosity
Ebbing and flowing
And pushed by a breeze
I live to make you free
But you can set sail to the west if you want to
And past the horizon
'Till I can't even see you
Far from here
Where the beaches are wide
Just leave me your wake to remember you by
If you'll be my star
I'll be your sky
You can hide underneath me
And come out at night
When I turn jet black
And you show off your light
I live to let you shine
But you cam skyrocket away from me
And never come back if you
Find another galaxy
Far from here
With more room to fly
Just leave me your stardust to remember you by
